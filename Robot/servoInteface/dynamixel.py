# Pythonic access to a Robotis AX-12 servo. Requires pySerial, but is
# otherwise pure Python, and should Just Work.
#
# There are two classes defined here; Response, which you probably don't care
# about, and ServoController, which you almost certainly do. A ServoController
# controls as many servos as you have plugged into a single port; each
# function takes a servo ID as its first argument, and then the actual meat of
# the instruction after that. See the individual function documentation for
# details. This doesn't implement every single option provided by the AX-12+,
# just the ones I need. However, using the existing functions as templates for
# new functions is as easy as copy-and-paste. The sole exception to this is
# that I haven't implemented broadcast packets; that would be trickier. I make
# many references to the AX-12 user manual, which you can easily find by
# googling.
#
# The values in the ERRORS dictionary describe all the things that might go
# wrong. 
#
# For a (very!) simple example of use, see the end of dynamixel.py.
